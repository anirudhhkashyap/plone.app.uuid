``uuidToObject``, ``uuidToURL`` and ``uuidToCatalogBrain`` return None when you are not authorized.
Previously you would get an Unauthorized error when calling these functions or trying to use the result.
``uuidToPhysicalPath`` is the only function that does not check security:
you get the path, whether you can see the object at that path or not.
